// Objects are basic simple entities which poses some properties and functions like laptop, pen paper, table etc
// we want our code as close to our real world

// let take example of a student
//         properties -> name, age, roll no, address, contact no.
//         functions -> change address, change no.


// class -> class is a blueprint that defines the properties and functions of a particular object (class is a template)

// object is specific copy of class
